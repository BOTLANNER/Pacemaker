## Agenda

I intend to address these issues / features for CampaignPacer in the relatively near future:

- Ability to add CampaignPacer to an existing savegame (without warping the current date)
  - Requires savegame serialization of current, symbolic calendar date [CODED, NOT TESTED]
- Ability to change the CampaignPacer calendar setting mid-playthrough (without warping the current date) [CODED, NOT TESTED]
  - Requires savegame serialization of current, symbolic calendar date [CODED, NOT TESTED]
- Auto-adjust pregnancy duration to `0.75 * DaysInYear`
- Synchronize daily and weekly ticks to the time-multiplied map clock

[... More to come ...]
